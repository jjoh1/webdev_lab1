  <p>Hello! My name is Justice. I am very interested in Computer Science and Engineering. I love creating both digital and physical things!</p>
  <p>I am excited to get started learning web desgin. I find it very cool that you can create somthing that is useable on almost every device without needing a native version for each one of them.</p>
  <p>I also have a great love for cats. I currently cannot have one, however I hope to get a Maine Coon cat in the future. I find the things that cats can do very impressive. I am facinated by their flexibility and speed.</p>
